            Welcome to my e-grimmoire fellow adventurers, mages and sinsister 
            cloaked figures. You better read closely because these potions may
            save your life someday and if you mix them wrong well... 
            I'd be ecstatic to see what happens but you probably won't be. 
            <strong>Nyahahahaha!</strong>
