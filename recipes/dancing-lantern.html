        <h1>Dancing Lantern Oil</h1>
        <!--insert image here-->
        <p>I must admit this potion is more delightful than it is necassary
            ,but what's the point of magic if you aren't having fun with it anyways. 
            This dancing lantern oil will be invaluable if you wish to explore
             ancient ruins with style instead of carying your lantern like some peasent.
             If you just pour a little into your lantern and light it, it will follow you
             leaving your hands free to do better things like disarming that pit fall trap 
             your about to step in.
