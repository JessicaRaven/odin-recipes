        <h1>Potion of Mage Armor</h1>
        <!--insert image-->
        <p>Mage Armor has stood between adventurers and their would be demise 
            on countless adventures. It can stop claws fangs arrows and more. But preparing mage 
            armor each and 
            every day is such a drag and wastes time that could be used to prep spells that
            will send your enemies into slumber leaving them at your mercy. <strong>Nyahahahah!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>And that's where this potion comes in, just simply chug it and those stupid kobolds 
            attacks will bounce off in futility. </p>
